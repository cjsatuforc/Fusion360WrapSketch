This script is used to wrap 2D sketch curves around a cylinder.

*NOTE* This addin was created before the Sheet Metal support was added to Fusion 360.  With that functionality it is now possible and easier to wrap sketch geometry.  See the following video for an example: https://youtu.be/xN5uqSyG6YA

## Installation

See the Autodesk Fusion 360 installation steps: https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html

## Video

## Limitations

- The sketch curves must be contained on the XY plane.
- The cylinder must be oriented with its axis aligned with the Z axis.
- Support sketch geometry:
 - Points
 - Lines
 - Splines

This add-in is a work-in-progress.  I hope to add new sketch geometry types soon.  Circles and arcs are two that I would like to add next.

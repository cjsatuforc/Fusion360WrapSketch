## Installation

See the Autodesk Fusion 360 installation steps: https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html

## Limitations

Currently a work in progress.

The sketch curves must be contained on the XY plane.  The cylinder must be oriented with its axis aligned with the Z axis.

Only sketch splines are wrapped.  Further types will be added.
